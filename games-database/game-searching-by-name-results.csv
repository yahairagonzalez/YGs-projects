141028,66349,Spider-Man: Total Mayhem,"At the start of the game, Spider-Man finds a group of thugs attacking a woman. He fights them off, only to have the woman he saved call him a freak and run away. Spider-Man is then seen chasing Sandman through New York City. They engage in combat and Sandman is defeated, just before Rhino throws a car at Spider-Man, who avoids it. Rhino manages to escape and then the Triskelion can be seen in flames. It is later revealed that the fire was caused by an explosion, which let all super-villains free from the prison, along with symbiotes created from a mixture of the venom suit and OZ formula. Throughout the game, Spider-Man has to fight several villains which appear in Ultimate Spider-Man comics, such as Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino. Many of the villains' followers have to be fought as well, like symbiotes, thugs and goblins.

After fighting Electro, the police talks to Spider-Man, saying that if he keeps fighting villains, they would have to send Roxxon security robots to get him, as they have the situation under control. After fighting Venom twice and facing a symbiote army, Spider-Man is informed by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that Norman Osborne (Green Goblin) has captured some baseball players, as well as the mayor and threatened to transform them into goblins unless the whole city is given to him. Spider-Man fights Doctor Octopus and then heads to the stadium, where he finds Green Goblin, who escapes. After chasing Norman through Manhattan, Spider-Man fights and defeats him. After defeated Green Goblin is taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who thank Spider-Man for his help and informs him that Dr. Connors (Lizard) had been working to create an antidote for the symbiotes left in the city.

At the end of the game, Spider-Man is sitting on a bench, when the woman which appears in the beginning of the game, comes to him and says he is not a freak after all, before photographing the two of them with her phone. Spider-Man tells her that he would appreciate if she did not upload the photograph to the internet, and then goes away.",2010-09-01 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

163739,4118,Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro,"Shortly after the Symbiote Invasion, a series of robberies led by Electro have taken place throughout New York City. While out on patrol, Spider-Man spots one of the robberies taking place at a building owned by BioTech. Planting a Spider-Tracer on the head thief's motorcycle, Spider-Man follows it to an abandoned warehouse where the thief is passing off a stolen briefcase to a contact. Spider-Man takes out the thugs and interrogates one of them, but is then attacked by the head thief: Shocker.

After defeating Shocker, Spider-Man follows the thug's tip and heads for the airfield, where the contact is heading towards. Along the way, Spider-Man is forced to disable a bomb threat, take out a machine-gun nest, and stop a runaway airplane from crashing. As the contact escapes via helicopter, Spider-Man is able to plant another tracer on it and track it to a trainyard owned by Hammerhead. Fighting through the mob-employed night staff and Sandman, Spider-Man races to catch a fleeing train and meets with the contact, who is revealed as The Beetle. The masked villain escapes with his briefcase, but he unknowingly leaves Spider-Man a clue: an invitation to the Science and Industry Ball.

Elsewhere, Electro explains his plan to the other villains. He and his partners have stolen the parts to the Bio-Nexus Device, which can amplify one's bio-energy to power a city block, and Electro plans to use it to increase his own powers. The device is currently incomplete, and only its creator Dr. Watts knows how to finish it. Hammerhead and his goons are sent to the Science and Industry Ball to take Dr. Watts hostage.

Though Spider-Man arrives at the Ball and manages to defeat Hammerhead, Sandman secretly escapes with the good doctor. Spider-Man decides to call Dr. Curt Conners at BioTech for some answers, but hears the sounds of a battle on the line. Spider-Man immediately infiltrates BioTech and reaches Dr. Connors's lab, where his alter-ego The Lizard is on an uncontrolled rampage. After being changed back to normal, Conners explains Electro's goal to become a god with the Bio-Nexus Device. He instructs Spider-Man to go and check out Dr. Watts' lab. Following a rooftop chase, Spider-Man eventually arrives at the lab and learns of the device's main power source, only to be caught in another battle with Sandman. After defeating Sandman by flushing him down the sewer grate with water, Spider-Man subsequently sees a newspaper article about the power source - a sapphire named Zeus's Tear - being on display at the museum. Electro is also informed of the jewel when one of his thugs brings him the same news article.

At the museum, Spider-Man catches up to Electro, who is still holding Dr. Watts as his hostage. He offers to give her up if Spider-Man gives him the Zeus's Tear. Spider-Man reluctantly obeys, and Electro tosses the doctor as Spider-Man throws the jewel. When Spider-Man attempts to snag the jewel back in midair with a web, Dr. Watts accidentally throws off his aim and he misses, allowing Electro to catch it. The Bio-Nexus Device complete, Electro activates it and flies off in an electrifying flash of lightning bolt. Spider-Man follows the villain to a massive conductor at a tower, where he supercharges himself into Hyper-Electro, a being of pure electrical energy. Unable to directly attack Electro, Spider-Man instead uses the tower's generators to overload and destroy the Bio-Nexus Device, ending Electro's power play for good.

The next day, The Mighty Thor is credited in the Daily Bugle as having saved New York from Electro, much to Spider-Man's disappointment. In prison, Electro sits in his cell moaning over his defeat while Hammerhead and Shocker play Poker. In a nearby cell, Doctor Octopus and the rest of the villains from the previous game are still locked up, and Shocker attempts to ask them if they know how to play Go Fish.",2001-10-19 00:00:00.000,20,NULL,40.0000,1,73.4728,57
